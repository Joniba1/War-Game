# Turn-Based Combat Game

In this turn-based combat game, each player commands an army and deploys a desired number of troops to battle against the opponent's forces.

# The Game Controls

The game's controls are quite simple. Each player has 3 buttons:


- Add Knight: adds a knight to the battling forces.

Note that lightning bolts won't stack, so might as well use them each round.

##

Each player has indicators on each side of the screen, displaying their remaining troops of each type.
The loser is the player who ran out of troops. 
When a round ends, players can add their remaining forces to the battlefield. A fter you've added troops, click Battle! again to start the next round.
