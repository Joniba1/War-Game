# Turn-Based Combat Game

In this turn-based combat game, each player commands an army and deploys a desired number of troops to battle against the opponent's forces.

## 

The game logic is quite simple. Each player has buttons controlling the amount of each type of troops they'd like to send to battle. When both players are done, click the Battle! button at the center of the screen and watch the battlefield.
