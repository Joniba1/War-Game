# Turn-Based Combat Game

In this turn-based combat game, each player commands an army and deploys a desired number of troops to battle against the opponent's forces.

## 

The game logic is quite simple. Each player has buttons controlling the amount of each type of troops they'd like to send to battle. When both players are done, click the Battle! button and the center of the screen and watch the battlfield.

-damage is randomized, but the type of the troop is taken into consideration.

-As for today the armies contain swordsmen and wizards. I figured ill add healers or some kind of other supporter quite late since its really simple and I prefer to finallize some more commplex stuff right not.

-currently im halfway through the proccess of implementing animations and textures.
 
Ik the directories are wrong, ill change them eventually
