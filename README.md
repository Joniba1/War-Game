# Turn-Based Combat Game

In this turn-based combat game, each player commands an army (currently represented as rectangles) and deploys a desired number of troops to battle against the opponent's unknown forces (hopefully, as both players are using same page).

## Core Mechanics

I have numerous ideas for the core mechanics of the game. Here are some considerations:

- Adding different types of troops based on their rank, such as foot troops, archers, and potentially mages or tanks in the future.
- Damage calculation will be based on ranks and random functions. Lower-rank soldiers will have a slim chance of defeating higher-rank ones due to their obvious differences in damage per second (DPS) and health points (HP). However, once an opponent is defeated, they'll provide assistance to their comrades, resulting in approximately double the damage to the remaining opponent's troops.

## Future Development

While animations and textures have not been implemented yet, I aim to add them eventually to make the game more interactive.
