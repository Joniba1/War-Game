# Turn-Based Combat Game

In this turn-based combat game, each player commands an army and deploys a desired number of troops to battle against the opponent's forces.

## 

The game logic is quite simple. Each player has buttons controlling the amount of each type of troops they'd like to send to battle. When both players are done, click the Battle! button at the center of the screen and watch the battlefield.

-damage is randomized, but the type of the troop is taken into consideration.

-As for today the armies contain swordsmen and wizards. I figured ill add healers or some another type of supporter quite late since it's  really simple and I prefer to finalize  some more complex stuff right now.

-currently, I'm halfway through the process  of implementing animations and textures.
 
Ik the directories are wrong, I'll change them eventually
