# Turn-Based Combat Game

In this turn-based combat game, each player commands an army and deploys a desired number of troops to battle against the opponent's forces.

# The Game Controls

The game's controls are quite simple. Each player has 3 buttons:

- Add Knight: adds a knight to the battling forces.
- Add Wizard: adds a wizard to the battling forces.
- Lightning: strikes the enemy forces with lightning bolts, 2 uses each round. 

Note that lightning bolts won't stack, so might as well use them each round.

##

Each player has indicators on each side of the screen, displaying their remaining troops of each type.
The loser is the player who ran out of troops. 
When a round ends, players can add their remaining troops to the battlefield. Click Battle! again to start the next round after you've added troops.
