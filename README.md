# Turn-Based Combat Game

In this turn-based combat game, each player commands an army (currently represented as rectangles) and deploys a desired number of troops to battle against the opponent's unknown forces (hopefully, as both players are using same page).

## 

I have numerous general ideas for the core mechanics of the game.

- Adding different types of troops based on their rank, such as foot troops, archers, and potentially mages or possibly tanks (giants or so) in the future.
- Damage will be based on ranks and random functions respectively. Lower-rank soldiers will have a slim chance of defeating higher-rank ones due to their obvious differences in dps and hp. However, once an opponent is defeated, they'll provide assistance to their comrades, resulting in approximately double the damage to the remaining opponent's troops.

While I haven't gotten around to implementing animations and textures just yet, I plan to add them eventually to make the game more interactive.
